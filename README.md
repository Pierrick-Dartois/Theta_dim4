# Theta_dim4 library (python/sagemath and C)

SageMath (and later C) library for fast computation of 2-isogenies in dimension 4 with theta coordinates of level 2 based on [1]. This library is designed for cryptographic applications (SQIsignHD, SIDH attacks, Clapoti...).

Copyright (c) 2024, Pierrick Dartois.

This library is divided into:

- `Theta_dim4_sage` where the `sagemath` code base is located.
- `Theta_dim4_C` where the `C` code base is located (work in progress).

Further instructions may be found in the `README.md` files of each sublibrary.
